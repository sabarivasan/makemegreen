I would like to reduce my plastic consumption
                                 Great, I can help you with that!
                                 Do you use restaurant-provided straws when you go to a restaurant or coffee shop?
Yes
                                 Consider not using a straw or using a steel straw when you dine out next.
                                 Refusing straws you XX green points per week!
