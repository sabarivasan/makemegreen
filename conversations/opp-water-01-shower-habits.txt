I would like to reduce my water consumption
                                 Great, I can help you with that!
                                 How long do you shower every day?
10 minutes
                                 Great, do you keep the water running throughout your shower?
Yes
                                 Did you know that the average American shower uses 17.2 gallons (65.1 liters) and lasts for 8.2 minutes at average flow rate of 2.1 gallons per minute (gpm) (7.9 lpm).
                                 Consider limiting your shower to 5 minutes every day.
                                 Also, consider shutting off the water while you are lathering.
                                 This saves 70 gallons of water per week and gives you XX green points per week!
