I would like to reduce my water consumption
                                 Great, I can help you with that!
                                 Do you have a lawn?
Yes
                                 Did you know that one-third of residential water use goes toward watering the lawn and garden?
                                 But flowers, grasses, and bushes native to the area have adapted to regional rainfall rates—so require no water—and have better defenses against predators.
                                 Another bonus: Native plants foster healthy soil and insect life, which attract birds and enhance overall biodiversity.
                                 This saves XX gallons of water per week and gives you XX green points per week!
