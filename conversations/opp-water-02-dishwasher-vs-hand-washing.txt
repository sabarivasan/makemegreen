I would like to reduce my water consumption
                                 Great, I can help you with that!
                                 Do you hand wash vessels?
Yes
                                 You use up to 27 gallons of water per load by hand versus as little as 3 gallons with an ENERGY STAR-rated dishwasher.
                                 Use a dishwasher as much as possible. Just scrape off large food scraps before loading!!
                                 This saves XX gallons of water per week and gives you XX green points per week!
