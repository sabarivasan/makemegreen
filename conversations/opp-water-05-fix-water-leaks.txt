I would like to reduce my water consumption
                                 Great, I can help you with that!
                                 Do you test your toiler and taps for water leaks on a regular basis?
No
                                 Did you know that a 1/16-inch opening in a leaking faucet could waste up to 100 gallons a day?
                                 Tour your home monthly, inside and out, in search of dripping faucets, showerheads, hoses, and sprinklers.
                                 Drop a dye tablet or food coloring in the tank yearly to see if the color of the water in the bowl changes color. If it does, your toilet needs a replacement rubber flapper or fill mechanism.
                                 This saves XX gallons of water per week and gives you XX green points per week!
