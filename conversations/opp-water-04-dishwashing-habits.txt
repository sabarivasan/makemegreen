I would like to reduce my water consumption
                                 Great, I can help you with that!
                                 Do you hand wash vessels?
Yes
                                 Great, do you keep the water running while you are scrubbing the vessels?
Yes
                                 Did you know that the average American kitchen tap has a flow rate of XX gallons per minute?
                                 Consider rinsing your vessels and closing the tap while you are scrubbing them.
                                 This saves XX gallons of water per week and gives you XX green points per week!
