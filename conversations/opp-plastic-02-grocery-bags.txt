I would like to reduce my plastic consumption
                                 Great, I can help you with that!
                                 Do you use plastic bags when you go to the grocery store?
Yes
                                 Did you know that a single plastic bag can take upto 1000 years to degrade.
                                 Consider taking one or more reusable cloth bags to the grocery store.
                                 You can buy them at most grocery stores.
                                 Each reusable bag gives you XX green points per week!
